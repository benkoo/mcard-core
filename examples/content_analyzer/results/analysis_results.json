    "title": "The given statement is that sin 2\ud835\udefc = 2 sin \ud835\udefc cos \ud835\udefc (without using the sum identity of sine). This can be proven by starting with triangle EBA, where angle EBA = \ud835\udefc. We can use this to find the values of EA and EB. Then, we can substitute these values into the equation sin 2\ud835\udefc = 2 sin \ud835\udefc cos \ud835\udefc. This will lead us to the result that (cos. \ud835\udefc + sin. \ud835\udefc) = 1.\n\nThe references provided do not directly support this specific proof of the Pythagorean theorem. They mainly discuss the history and development of trigonometry, as well as other related topics.",
