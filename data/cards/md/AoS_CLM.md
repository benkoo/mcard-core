# Encode, Enumerate, Evaluate

After creating the [[ToDo App]] and the Content Analyzer class for the initial version of [[MCard]] yesterday, I found it challenging to move forward due to the overwhelming number of possibilities. A systematic approach to incrementally categorize these possibilities would be extremely beneficial. In essence, we need to classify or divide the future possibility space into discrete chunks. This would allow us to progress using a set of [[Breadcrumbs]]—markers that indicate where we’ve been and where we should go next. Interestingly, this methodology aligns with work I conducted 20 years ago and later published 15 years ago in the [[AoS]] paper.

## How to Make [[MCard]] Generative?

To build a generative system for [[MCard]], we need to encode a special type of [[MCard]] using the [[AoS]] language. This system should incorporate three distinct domains:

1. **Property Domain**  
    Encodes functional specifications as key-value pairs (often called a dictionary or hash table). This corresponds to the [[Abstract Specification]] in the [[Cubical Logic Model]].
    
2. **Composition Domain**  
    Encodes causal relations using the [[Petri Net]] formalism, recognized for its universal expressiveness. Execution traces of the [[Concrete Implementation]] are stored in the [[MCard]] format as specified in the [[AoS]] paper.
    
3. **Boolean Domain**  
    Represents pre- and post-conditions for verifying the correctness of individual transitions. This domain evolves from the documentation in the [[AoS]] paper.

### Information Flow and Integration

The information flow is defined using the [[Cubical Logic Model]]. Similar to markdown notes in [[Obsidian]], the [[Abstract Specification]] serves as the **front-matter**, storing the context, goals, and [[Success Criteria]]. The [[Concrete Implementation]] contains the input resources required, the [[Petri Net]] for generating [[MCards]], and the associated outputs. Once [[MCards]] are generated, their [[Realistic Expectations]] are evaluated and documented based on an algorithm aligned with the [[Success Criteria]] outlined in the seed MCard's **front-matter**.

To support this process, mechanisms such as Bayesian inference, including [[LDA]], can be employed for preliminary assessments of the generated [[MCards]]. The ultimate objective is to create a unified data structure capable of integrating both deterministic and probabilistic semantics. It's important to note that an [[MCard]] corresponds to the concept of a token as described in the original [[AoS]] paper.

## Evaluation and LDA

An effective evaluation mechanism leverages Bayesian inference techniques, particularly [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]] (LDA), in conjunction with large language models for tasks like summarization, inference, and translation. This marks a transformative advancement, shifting the traditionally human-intensive process of crafting natural language statements toward automation. This innovation unlocks immense potential for systematically processing and analyzing the vast repository of knowledge and experience encoded in natural language, making it computationally accessible during each cycle of system analysis. Furthermore, [[LDA]] plays a critical role in identifying essential vocabulary and determining the optimal vocabulary size, ensuring these insights can be seamlessly integrated into the training or fine-tuning processes of large language models.

### The Role of [[LDA]] in System Evaluation

[[LDA]] acts as a cornerstone within this framework, identifying statistical distributions of relevance in textual data. Its versatile and generalized methodology enables the preliminary evaluation of natural language content, bridging the gap between human-readable text and computational analysis. Within the [[MCard]] framework, [[LDA]] fulfills three key roles:

1. **Semantic Analysis**: It parses and uncovers relationships within the natural language content of the [[Abstract Specification]], offering insights into its structure and meaning.
2. **Computational Integration**: It connects the insights derived from semantic analysis with the computational outputs of the [[Concrete Implementation]], creating a seamless interaction between human language and machine-executable results.
3. **Simulation Insights**: It interprets data produced by multiple runs of the token generation process, providing statistical inferences that reflect variations in simulation conditions and outcomes.

By integrating these functions, [[LDA]] unifies the domains of semantic understanding, computational processes, and simulation analysis. This integration supports the creation of a cohesive system where deterministic computations and probabilistic semantics are harmonized.

### Enhancing the [[Cubical Logic Model]]

The evaluation process integrates [[LDA]] with the [[Cubical Logic Model]] to enable a generative and iterative system refinement cycle. Here’s how this process unfolds:

- **Token Enumeration and Storage**: The tokens, or [[MCards]], generated during system analysis are stored within the [[Realistic Expectations]] field, representing various simulation runs.
- **Data Accumulation and Analysis**: As more simulations are conducted, the accumulated execution traces provide a rich dataset for evaluation using [[LDA]]. This analysis extracts meaningful patterns and relationships, offering insights into how the system operates under different conditions.
- **Feedback for System Evolution**: Insights from [[LDA]] are used to refine the natural language content in the [[Abstract Specification]]. This ensures that the front matter evolves in tandem with the system’s increasing complexity and knowledge base.

### Towards a Unified Semantic Framework

The integration of [[LDA]] within the [[MCard]] and [[Cubical Logic Model]] frameworks marks a transformative advancement in making natural language data both computable and actionable. By leveraging probabilistic models like [[LDA]], the [[MCard]] framework moves beyond deterministic computation to enable a dynamic, continuous feedback loop. This iterative process supports the evolution of system specifications by systematically refining semantic layers, adapting vocabulary to align with domain-specific requirements, and incorporating existing knowledge.

At the core of this success is the [[MCard]]'s highly compact data structure, which provides an efficient and flexible means of encoding arbitrary data representations. This capability not only enhances the clarity and precision of system specifications but also ensures seamless integration between natural language content and computational outputs. By bridging the gap between human-centric specifications and machine-executable systems, the [[MCard]] framework fosters a unified, scalable approach to computable language development. Ultimately, this innovation establishes a robust methodology for managing the evolution dynamics of system design tasks, guided by the interplay of deterministic reasoning and probabilistic insights.
