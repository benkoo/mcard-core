ABSTRAK
We introduce the Primary Gasing Triangle, a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 1 unit, to define the Primary Trigonometric Functions: sine and cosine. This triangle serves as the foundational element in a new approach to learning trigonometry, enabling us to derive the Derived Gasing Triangle, where the other four trigonometric functions (tangent, secant, cotangent, and cosecant) are defined. Using the Primary Gasing Triangle, we derive key Trigonometric formulas, provide several proofs of the Pythagorean theorem using Trigonometry, and solve various Trigonometry problems. This approach makes learning trigonometry simpler, easier, and more intuitive.

Introduction
Trigonometry is known as the study of angles and sides of a triangle. The name Trigonometry itself can be interpreted as triangle measurement. To facilitate the relationship between angles and triangles, six Trigonometric ratios or functions known as sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant were introduced ([1]) ([2]).
Initially, these six Trigonometric functions were defined as line segments ([3]). Later, this definition was changed to Trigonometric ratios, which represent the ratios of sides in a right triangle. This ratio definition is used in almost all Trigonometry textbooks ([4]) ([5]). However, this ratio-based definition does not provide a clear physical meaning and is diSicult to apply for angles greater than 90 degrees. It also does not reflect the periodic nature of Trigonometric functions, preventing us from gaining a full understanding of various periodic phenomena such as waves, vibrations, light, sound, alternating current, or all other periodic phenomena, which is the primary importance of Trigonometry ([6]). The unclear physical meaning and applications of Trigonometry significantly aSect students' motivation to learn it. Students memorize formulas without understanding their origins and quickly forget this subject after passing the test ([7]).

 Figure 1.
In Figure 1, we introduce three similar triangles, which we call the Gasing Triangle, where one side of the triangle, AB, has a length of 1 unit. We name the triangle ABC the Primary Gasing Triangle with a hypotenuse length of 1 unit. The triangles ADB and EAB are introduced as Derived Gasing Triangles, the reasoning for which will be explained later.
We depict these Gasing Triangles in Cartesian coordinates and also illustrate a circle with a radius of 1 unit to facilitate the extension of the Trigonometric function definitions to obtuse angles.
The term Gasing in Segitiga Gasing is an acronym derived from the Indonesian phrase tiGA SIku pentiNG (meaning "three important right triangles"), referring to the three Gasing Triangles shown in Figure 1. Additionally, the word Gasing is often used to describe a learning method that is GAmpang (easy), aSIk (fun), and meNyenangkan (enjoyable) ([8]).
In this paper, we will demonstrate that the key element in learning Trigonometry lies in the Primary Gasing Triangle. Using this triangle, we will define and provide a physical meaning for the sine and cosine functions, which we refer to as the Primary Trigonometric Functions. Additionally, the Primary Gasing Triangle allows us to derive the other trigonometric functions, which we call Derived Trigonometric Functions, prove the Pythagorean theorem using Trigonometry, and derive essential Trigonometric formulas such as the sum and diSerence formulas, as well as the sine and cosine rules. We also extend the definition of the Primary Trigonometric Functions to obtuse angles. In Appendix 1, we provide examples of solving Trigonometry problems using the Primary Gasing Triangle, while in Appendix 2, we oSer several proofs of the Pythagorean theorem using the Primary Trigonometric Functions, which were previously thought to be impossible ([9]).

Defining Trigonometric Functions
First, we draw the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC from Figure 1, as shown in Figure 2. Here, the length of side AB is 1 unit, the length of side BC is defined as sin α, and the length of side AC is defined as cos α, with α being an acute angle (0 ≤ α ≤ 90°). It is clear that we define sin α as the length of the vertical side (the side opposite angle α) and cos α as the length of the horizontal side (the side adjacent to angle α) in the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC.
 Figure 2
For obtuse angles, the definitions of sine and cosine are extended as the projections of a unit vector onto the y-axis and x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system. This extension remains consistent with the previous definition. The unit vector approach we use here diSers from the unit circle approach ([10], [11]). While the unit circle approach can explain Trigonometric functions for obtuse angles, it lacks a clear physical meaning, particularly in applications related to physics or engineering ([6]).
The other four trigonometric functions—secant, cosecant, tangent, and cotangent—are defined as the sides of two triangles, ADB and EAB, as shown in Figure 1. To calculate the unknown sides of triangles ADB and EAB, we use the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC as a reference.
In Figure 3a, the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC and the similar triangle ADB are depicted.
 Figure 3a.

For similar triangles, the corresponding sides are connected by the same scaling factor. SincesideAC=cosαisconnectedtosideAB=1unitbyascalingfactorof ! ,

sides AD and BD can be calculated by multiplying this scaling factor by sides AB and CB, respectively.
We obtain:

This result is illustrated in Figure 3b.
Similarly, we can use the same method to calculate the unknown sides of triangle EAB.

Since triangles ABC and EAB are similar, the lengths of sides EA and EB can be obtained by multiplying the lengths of sides AB and AC by this scaling factor.
We obtain:
𝐸𝐴 = 𝐴𝐵 ×𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟= 1 × ! ,hence 𝐸𝐴= !
𝐸𝐵 = 𝐴𝐶 ×𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟= cos𝛼× ! ,hence 𝐸𝐵="#$% $&' % $&' %
Figure 4b
This result is shown in Figure 4b.
Now, we define the side lengths as follows: AD = sec α, BD = tan α, EB = cot α, and EA = csc α. This allows us to establish the relationships between these four trigonometric functions and the Primary Trigonometric Functions, sine and cosine, that we defined earlier.
These relationships are expressed in equations (1) through (4).

Figures 5a-c and Figure 6 illustrate the six trigonometric functions, represented as the sides of the three Gasing Triangles.
Figure 5a-c.
Figure 6
From the explanation above, the side lengths of the Gasing Triangles ADB and EAB in Figures 5b and 5c are derived from the side lengths of the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC in Figure 5a.
  
Therefore, we refer to triangle ABC as the Primary Gasing Triangle, while ADB and EAB are referred to as Derived Gasing Triangles.
We also observe that the trigonometric functions secant, tangent, cosecant, and cotangent can be expressed in terms of the sine and cosine functions. Therefore, sine and cosine are called Primary Trigonometric Functions, while the other four functions are referred to as Derived Trigonometric Functions.
For all subsequent trigonometric calculations or derivations of trigonometric formulas in the remainder of this paper, we will rely solely on the Primary Gasing Triangle and the appropriate scaling factors.

Proving the Pythagorean Theorem with Trigonometry
Elisha Scott Loomis claimed that it is impossible to prove the Pythagorean Theorem using Trigonometry ([9]). However, more recently, there have been several proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem using Trigonometry ([12], [13], [14]).
In this section, we will provide a Trigonometric proof of the Pythagorean Theorem using the Primary Gasing Triangle.
To do so, we will first calculate the side lengths of all the triangles depicted in Figure 1.
The lengths of sides AD and DE can be determined by the similarity between triangle EDA and the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC, using a scaling factor of ! .
 ! ! ()* % ,-( % WefindthatthelengthofAD =,-(% andDE=()*%,-(%.
 For the sides BD and CD, we use the similarity between the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC andtriangleBDC,applyingascalingfactorof ()*%.
,-( %
This gives us the lengths BD =()* % and CD = ()*!%. ,-( % ,-( %
The complete results for all the side lengths of the triangles in Figure 1 are shown in Figure 7. It is important to note that these calculations are based solely on the use of side ratios (scaling factors) and the similarity of right triangles.

 From Figure 7, we observe the following:
AD=AC+CD......(5)
! =cos𝛼+ $&'!% ......(6)
By equalizing the denominators, we obtain:
! ="#$!%+ $&'!% .....(7) "#$% "#$% "#$%
The above equation simplifies to: 1 = cos. 𝛼 + sin. 𝛼 ..... (8)
"#$ % "#$ %
Figure 7
This result is a fundamental Trigonometric identity. Notably, we obtained this result using only the similarity and the ratios of the sides of the triangles.
Using the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC (Figure 5a), we see that equation (8) is, in fact, the Pythagorean Theorem:
𝐴𝐵.=𝐴𝐶.+𝐶𝐵. (9)

Thus, we see that by proving the Trigonometric identity, we simultaneously prove the Pythagorean Theorem. Therefore, there is no circular reasoning involved.
We can also prove this trigonometric identity (the Pythagorean Theorem) using Figure 7, whereDE=DB+BE.
Explicitly, this can be written as: ! = ()*% + "#$% .....(10)
By equalizing the denominators, we obtain: ! = ()*!% + "#$!% ....(11)
$&'/"#$% "#$%$&'% $&'%"#$%
Equation (11) simplifies to 1 = cos. 𝛼 + sin. 𝛼, just as we expected.
Here, we see that the Pythagorean Theorem can indeed be proven using Trigonometry without any concern for circularity argument.
In Appendix 2, we provide additional proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem using Trigonometry. We observe that all valid proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem, whether geometric or algebraic ([9]), can be demonstrated through Trigonometric proofs using the Primary Gasing Triangle and the appropriate scaling factors.
With the Pythagorean Theorem now proven, we can easily demonstrate the following identities using Figures 5b and 5c.

Sum and DiBerence Formulas
In this section, we will derive the formulas for 𝑐𝑜𝑠 (𝛼 ± 𝛽) and sin(𝛼 ± 𝛽) using the Primary Gasing Triangle.
InFigure8a,weobservethePrimaryGasingTriangleABCwith∠𝐵𝐴𝐶 = 𝛼.Thehypotenuse ABis1unitlong.Thesideoppositeangle𝛼isBC= sin𝛼,andthesideadjacenttoangle𝛼 is AC = cos 𝛼. We then construct a right triangle ACF, with F as the right angle and
∠𝐶𝐴𝐹 = 𝛽.
Figure 8a Figure 8b
To calculate the lengths of AF and CF, we use the Primary Gasing Triangle
𝐴 𝐶 𝐹 (Figure 8b), which is similar to triangle ACF, with the hypotenuse 𝐴 𝐶 = 1 unit. The !!! !!
side opposite angle 𝛽 is F!C! = sin 𝛽, and the side adjacent to angle 𝛽 is A!F! = cos 𝛽. The Primary Gasing Triangle 𝐴 𝐶 𝐹 and triangle ACF are related by a scaling factor cos 𝛼.
Therefore, the lengths of sides FC and AF can be obtained by multiplying this scaling factor bythelengths𝐹𝐶 and 𝐴 𝐹. Theresultsare𝐹𝐶=cosαsin𝛽and 𝐴𝐹=cos𝛼cos𝛽.
  !! !!
!!!
Next, we construct a right triangle CBG with a perpendicular at G, where angle BCG is β, as shown in Figure 8c.

 Figure 8c
Since triangle CBG is similar to the Primary Gasing Triangle 𝐴 𝐶 𝐹 with a scaling factor of
!!!
𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼, we can calculate the lengths of CG and GB by multiplying this scaling factor by the
lengths 𝐴 𝐹 dan 𝐹 𝐶 . !! !!
Theresultsare 𝐶𝐺=sin𝛼cos𝛽and 𝐺𝐵=sin𝛼sin𝛽.
Next, we draw line HB. Notice that triangle ABH is a Primary Gasing Triangle with its
hypotenuseAB=1unitand∠𝐵𝐴𝐻= 𝛼+𝛽,asshowninFigure8d.
Figure 8d
 
Here,𝐴𝐻 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝛼+𝛽)andHB=𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝛼 +𝛽) From Figure 8d, we can see that:
HB=FC+CG
or
sin(𝛼+𝛽)=cos𝛼sin𝛽+sin𝛼cos𝛽 -----(14) By setting 𝛼 = 𝛽, we obtain:
sin2𝛼 = 2sin𝛼cos𝛼 ----(15)
Also, from Figure 8d, we have:
AH=AF–HF
or
cos (𝛼 + 𝛽) = cos 𝛼 cos 𝛽 − sin 𝛼 sin 𝛽 ---- (16)
By setting α = β, we obtain:
cos 2𝛼 = cos. 𝛼 − sin. 𝛼 ----(17)
Next, by applying the identity cos. 𝛼 + sin. 𝛼 = 1 to equation (16), we obtain: cos2𝛼=2cos.𝛼−1 ----(18)
and
cos2𝛼=1−2sin.𝛼 ----(19)
Equations (15), (17), (18), and (19) are known as the double-angle identities.
To derive the formulas for sin(𝛼 − 𝛽) and cos(𝛼 − 𝛽), we can use equations (14) and (16) by substituting 𝛽 with − 𝛽
Alternatively, we can use a similar approach as above, but with the aid of Figure 8e (we leave the proof of these side lengths as an exercise for the readers).

 Figure 8e
In the figure, it is clear that:
CB=HF–BG
so
sin(𝛼 − 𝛽) = sin 𝛼 cos 𝛽 − cos 𝛼 sin 𝛽 .... (20)
And
AC=AH+HC
so
cos(𝛼 − 𝛽) = cos 𝛼 cos 𝛽 + sin 𝛼 sin 𝛽 ....(21)
We can see how beautifully the sum and diSerence identities for cosine and sine are derived using the Primary Gasing Triangle and the appropriate scaling factors.

Sine and Cosine Rules
The sine and cosine rules can be derived using the Primary Gasing Triangle with the following steps:
First, we construct two Primary Gasing Triangles, ABD and CFE, as shown in Figures 9a-b.
Figure 9a-b
Next, we multiply the sides of triangle ABD by the scaling factor a and the sides of triangle CFE by the scaling factor c, so that the length of the sides new DB is equal to new EF. Now we have a new triangle ABC which is not a right triangle (see Figure 9c).
Figure 9c
From the figure, it can be seen that the side DB satisfies:
𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼 = 𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛾.....(22)
From this, we obtain the sine rule:
  
0 = , ........(23) $&' % $&' 1
Now,let'sdefinethelengthAC= 𝑏. Since AC=AD+DC,wehave:
𝑏 = 𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼 + 𝑎𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛾.
In triangle CBD, we use the Pythagorean theorem:
𝐶𝐵. = 𝐷𝐶. + 𝐷𝐵.
to find:
𝑎. =(𝑏−𝑐cos 𝛼). +𝑐.𝑠𝑖𝑛.𝛼............(24)
With some algebra, we get:
𝑎. =(𝑏. +𝑐.(cos. 𝛼+sin.𝛼)−2𝑏𝑐cos𝛼)⬚ .......(25)
Using the trigonometric identity cos. 𝛼 + sin. 𝛼 = 1, we obtain: 𝑎. =𝑏. +𝑐. −2𝑏𝑐cos𝛼....(26)
which is the Cosines rule.
We have derived the Sines Rule and the Cosines Rule using the Primary Gasing Triangle and the appropriate scaling factors. In solving trigonometric problems, we recommend not relying solely on memorized the rules but rather encouraging students to solve problems using the Primary Gasing Triangle and appropriate scaling factors, as explained in several examples in Appendix 1.

Cofunction Identity
In Figure 6, let’s name the angle EAB = 𝛾 = 903 − 𝛼. Since triangle ABC is a Primary Gasing Triangle, AC = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛾 and the length of side BC = 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛾 The lengths of the other sides can be obtained in the same manner as we did for the side lengths of the triangle in Figure 6, but for the angle 𝛾 . The results are as shown in Figure 10.
Figure 10
From the figure above, we observe the cofunction identities for the six trigonometric functions:
cosγ= cosW4 −𝛼X=sin𝛼.....(27) .
sinγ= sinW4 −𝛼X=cos𝛼.....(28) .
secγ= secW4−𝛼X=csc𝛼.....(29) .
cscγ= cscW4 −𝛼X=sec𝛼......(30) .
tanγ= tanW4 −𝛼X=cot𝛼.....(31) .
cot 𝛾 = cot W4 − 𝛼X = tan 𝛼 .....(32) .
These cofunction identities illustrate how each trigonometric function of an angle is related to another function of its complementary angle.
 
Primary Trigonometric Functions for Obtuse Angles
We have seen that the most important trigonometric functions are sine and cosine, which we refer to as the Primary Trigonometric Functions. We have also already explored the definitions of sine and cosine for acute angles as the lengths of the vertical and horizontal sides of the Primary Gasing Triangle.
For obtuse angles (𝜃 > 903), the definition of the side lengths of the triangle becomes the projection of the unit vector onto the y-axis and x-axis in Cartesian coordinates. This definition diSers from the one given in the unit circle concept ([15], [16], [17]). In the unit circle concept, the values of the trigonometric functions are determined solely based on the coordinates of the point on the terminal side of the angle that lies on the unit circle, without providing a physical meaning for those coordinates.
Assume the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC in Figure 1 is placed on the Cartesian coordinate system such that side AC lies on the x-axis and ∠𝐵𝐴𝐶 = 𝛼. Here, the length of AC is 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛼 and the length of CB is 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼. The coordinates of point B are B(cos 𝛼, sin 𝛼), as shown in Figure 11a.
Figure 11a
Next, we transform side AB of this triangle into a unit vector that forms an angle 𝜃 with the x-axis. Here, 𝜃 = 𝛼, as shown in Figure 11b.
 
 Gambar 11b
We define 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 as the projection of the unit vector 𝐴𝐵 onto the y-axis, while cos 𝜃 is the projection of the unit vector 𝐴𝐵 onto the x-axis. Here, the coordinates of point 𝐵 represent these projections: the abscissa (x-coordinate) represents the projection of the unit vector 𝐴𝐵 onto the x-axis, and the ordinate (y-coordinate) represents the projection onto the y- axis. The unit vector 𝐴𝐵can rotate freely around point 𝐴.
Using the new definitions of sine and cosine, let's calculate the values for all obtuse angles.
1. ObtuseAngleintheSecondQuadrant(90° < 𝜽< 180°):
a. RotatetheUnitVector
Rotate unit vector 𝐴𝐵 = 1 unit to form an angle 𝜃 = (1803 − 𝛼) with the x- axis, as shown in Figure 11c.

 Figure 11c
b. ConstructthePrimaryGasingTriangleABC:
As shown in Figure 11d, with the Primary Gasing Triangle properties, we have 𝐴𝐶 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛼 and 𝐶𝐵 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼.
c. DeterminetheCoordinatesofPointB:
The coordinates of point B are B (−𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛼, 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼 )
Figure 11d.
d. CalculateProjections.
The value of sin(1803 − 𝛼) is the projection of the unit vector 𝐴𝐵 onto the y-axis, which is the vector 𝐴𝐷, equal to + 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼 (positive because the unit vector is directed
 
towards the positive y-axis). Thisi is the same as the ordinate (y-coordinate) of point B.
Thevalueof cos(1803−𝛼)istheprojectionoftheunitvector𝐴𝐵ontothex-axis, whichisthevector𝐴𝐶,equalto−cos𝛼 (negativebecausetheunitvectoris directed towards the negative x-axis). This is the same as the abscissa (x- coordinate) of point B.
We can write the results as: 𝑐𝑜𝑠(1803 −𝛼) = −𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼.....(33)
𝑠𝑖𝑛(1803 −𝛼) = 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼.......(34)
These results show how the values of sine and cosine are determined for an obtuse angle in the second quadrant using the projection method with the Gasing Triangle. This approach maintains a clear physical interpretation by using Cartesian coordinates and projections.
2. Obtuse Angle in the Third Quadrant (𝟏𝟖𝟎𝟎 < 𝜽 < 𝟐𝟕𝟎𝟎).
Using the steps we followed for obtuse angles in the second, and referring to Figures
11e and 11f, we obtain the following results:
Figure 11e.
 
 Figure 11f.
The value of 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (1803 + 𝛼) is the projection of the unit vector 𝐴𝐵 onto the y-axis, which is the vector 𝐴𝐷, equal to − 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼 ((negative because the unit vector is directed towards the negative y-axis). This is the same as the ordinate (y-coordinate) of point B).
The value of 𝑐𝑜𝑠 (1803 + 𝛼) is the projection of the unit vector 𝐴𝐵 onto the x-axis,whichisthevector𝐴𝐶equalto−cos𝛼 (negativebecausetheunit vector is directed towards the negative x-axis). This is the same as the abscissa (x-coordinate) of point 𝐵.
We can write the results as: 𝑐𝑜𝑠(1803 +𝛼) = −𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼.....(35)
𝑠𝑖𝑛(1803 +𝛼)= −𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼.......(36)
3. Obtuse Angle in the Fourth Quadrant (2703 < 𝜃 < 3603):
Using the steps we followed for obtuse angles in the second, and referring to Figures 11g and 11h, we obtain the following results:
𝑐𝑜𝑠(3603 −𝛼) = 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼.....(37) 𝑠𝑖𝑛(3603 −𝛼)= −𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼.......(38)

 Figure 11g.
Figure 11h.
Defining sine and cosine as the projections of a unit vector in Cartesian coordinates allows us to calculate the values of these trigonometric functions for any angle of inclination of this unit vector. This enables these trigonometric functions to describe periodic motion, such as vibrations, waves, light, etc.
By using this method, we can consistently extend the definitions of sine and cosine to cover all angles, maintaining a clear physical interpretation of their values based on projections in the Cartesian plane.
 
CONCLUSION
The primary trigonometric functions 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 and 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝜃 are defined as the projections on the y-axis and x-axis of a unit vector that forms an angle 𝜃 with the x-axis.
For acute angles, the projections of the unit vector, 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝜃 and cos 𝜃, can be reduced to the side lengths of the Primary Gasing Triangle, as shown in Figure 2.
For other trigonometric functions, or derived trigonometric functions (secant, tangent, cosecant, and cotangent), their values are determined based on the primary trigonometric functions, given by equations (1), (2), (3), and (4). For acute angles, these derived trigonometric functions are represented as the side lengths of the derived Gasing Triangles shown in Figures 5b and 5c.
All derivations of formulas and solutions to trigonometric problems can be accomplished using the Primary Gasing Triangle and the appropriate scaling factors. This makes learning trigonometry simpler, more understandable, and more intuitive. Students do not need to memorize numerous formulas that may not be particularly useful later.
With the Primary Gasing Triangle, we have also demonstrated that it is quite feasible to prove the Pythagorean Theorem using trigonometry.
The definition of Primary Trigonometric Functions for all angles allows trigonometric functions to better explain various periodic phenomena such as vibration motion, waves, sound, light, or other aspects related to periodic motion. This will make learning trigonometry even more meaningful, and students will be more likely to enjoy the subject.

If𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼 =! whatis𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼? .
Solution:
Let's draw the Primary Gasing Triangle as shown in Figure A1.1.
Figure A1.1.
We can calculate 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛼 using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶.
g.1.1 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼= 1–i2j =2√3
This problem can also be solved using the trigonometric identity 1 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠.𝛼 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛.𝛼. However, solving it by memorizing formulas does not train students to think critically and logically, which is the spirit of teaching. By using the Primary Gasing Triangle, students can visually and logically understand the relationships between the sides and angles, leading to a deeper comprehension of trigonometry.

 Figure A1.2b
Using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle 𝐴′𝐵′𝐶′, we get:
 Therefore,

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼 =4 5
Again, by using the Primary Gasing Triangle approach, we can visually and logically determine the relationships between the trigonometric functions, leading to a deeper understanding of trigonometry concepts.

Problem 3:
Calculate the value of a in Figure A1.3a below:
Figure A1.3a
The first step is to create the Primary Gasing Triangles ABC and DEF. Then use the scaling factor a on the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC to obtain Triangle KLN.
Similarly, use the scaling factor 6 on the Primary Gasing Triangle DEF to obtain Triangle MLN, as shown in Figure A1.3b.
  Figure A1.3b
On side LN, we observe that 𝑎 𝑠𝑖𝑛 303 = 6 𝑠𝑖𝑛 453.

Therefore
𝑎.! = 6.!√2 ..
This results in:
𝑎 = 6√2
Why don't we just use the Sine Rule from equation (23)? It's straightforward. That's true, but again we are not too interested in having students memorize formulas. Instead, we want to encourage students to prioritize creativity, computational logic, and critical thinking. This approach makes learning trigonometry more engaging.
Problem 4:
Calculate the value of 𝑎 in the triangle in figure A1.4a.!
Figure A1.4a
We can solve this using the Cosine Rule as shown in Equation (26). However, in the spirit of Gasing, we prefer not to have students memorize formulas. A more engaging method is to use the Primary Gasing Triangle and the associated scaling factor.
 
We create the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC with angle BAC = 603. Then, use the scaling factor 6 to obtain Triangle MLN, as shown in Figure A1.4b.
Figure A1.4b.
Use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle 𝐾𝐿𝑁. 𝑎=r(8+6cos603). +(6sin603).
   From this we get

We first create the Primary Gasing Triangles AEF with angle 𝛼 = 453 and AGH with angle 𝛼 = 303.
Figure A1.6b
  
In Figure A1.6a, Triangles ABC and ADC have the same length horizontal side AC. Therefore, we will scale both Primary Gasing Triangles AEF and AGH so that the lengths of their horizontal sides will be equal. For this, the scaling factor for
Triangle AEF is 8 , and the scaling factor for Triangle AGH is "#$ 79"
Thus, we obtain the following figure:

Appendix 2: Some Proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem with Trigonometry
In this section, we will prove the Pythagorean theorem using the Primary Gasing Triangle for several cases found in various references (9)(10)(16)(19)(20). We have observed that various algebraic or geometric proofs of Pythagoras can be transformed into trigonometric proofs using the Primary Gasing Triangle.
In each case, we will prove 1 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠.𝛼 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛.𝛼. We will not use the Pythagorean theorem for this proof. This proof is equivalent to proving the Pythagorean theorem as shown in Figure 5a. Thus, we simultaneously prove both the trigonometric identity and the Pythagorean theorem. There is no circularity of argument.
Case 1:
In this figure, we construct a square ABCD and within it, a smaller square EFGH with side length 1 unit. Here, we have four similar Primary Gasing Triangles: HEA, GHD, FGC and EFB.
Figure A2.1
In Figure A2.1, since
the area of triangle HEA = the area of triangle GHD = the area of triangle FGC = the area of triangle EFB
And
The area of square ABCD = the area of square EFGH + 4 times the area of triangle EFB. Then,
 (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼). = 1 + 4𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼
 ..2
cos 𝛼 + sin 𝛼+2sin𝛼cos𝛼 = 1 + 2𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼

We obtain:
As we expected.
Case 2:
cos.𝛼 + sin.𝛼 = 1
In Figure A2.2, inside the square ABCD, there is a smaller square EFGH, and four Primary Gasing Triangles.
In the figure, it is shown that the length of HG is given by:
𝐻𝐺 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼– 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼
 Figure A2.2
Also, we observe that:
Areaof ABCD=Areaof EFGH+4xAreaof AFB

Therefore,
1 = (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼– 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼). +(4 × 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼) 2
 With a bit of algebra, we get:
1 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠.𝛼– 2𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛.𝛼 + 2𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼
which simplifies to:
1 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠.𝛼 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛.𝛼
As expected.
Case 3:
n figure A2.3a, we have a Primary Gasing Triangle ABC with the length of AB equal to 1 unit.
Figure A2.3a
Then, we draw a line CD perpendicular to line AB. Next, use the scaling factor cos 𝛼 to obtain the sides of triangle ACD, where 𝐴𝐷 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠.𝛼 and 𝐶𝐷 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛼. Then use the scalingfactor𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼toobtain𝐷𝐵 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛.𝛼,asshowninFigureA2.3b.
 
 Figure A2.3b
From the figure, it can be seen that AD+DB=AB
Thus, we obtain,
Thus, we have proven it as expected.
Case 4:
cos.𝛼 + sin.𝛼 = 1
Figure A2.4a shows the diameter BC of a circle perpendicular to line DE where AF < radius of the circle AC.

 Figure A2.4a
We create the Gasing Triangle ADF with hypotenuse AD = 1 unit.
Since points E and B lie on the circle, triangle BDF is similar to triangle ECF. Since DE is perpendicular to CB, the length of FE = DF = 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛼. Letthe∠𝐹𝐸𝐶 = 𝛽
Figure A2.4b
Next, we create the Gasing Triangle GIH similar to triangle ECF.
 
By using the scale factor W"#$ % X on triangle GIH, we obtain triangle ECF. "#$ A
Thus, we find the side lengths FC = sin𝛽 × W"#$% X and EC = W"#$% X. "#$ A "#$ A
Next,usethescalingfactorW"#$% XontheGasingTriangleGIH,usethescalingfactorto $&' A

$&' A
and DB=W"#$% X.
The complete side lengths of these triangles are shown in Figure A2.4c.
Figure A2.4c
Sincetheradiusofthecircleis1unit,thenFC=1– 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼andFB=1 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝛼.Thus,we
$&' A
 have the equations:
1 − sin 𝛼 = cos 𝛼 × sin 𝛽 cos 𝛽

1 + sin 𝛼 = cos 𝛼 × cos 𝛽 sin 𝛽
Multiplying the above two equations, we get:
or
As we expected.
Case 5:
1 − sin. 𝛼 = cos. 𝛼 cos.𝛼 + sin.𝛼 = 1
 Figure A2.5a
In Figure A2.5a, points C and D are on a circle with a radius of 1 unit. The Primary Gasing Triangle ADF has a hypotenuse AD of 1 unit.
Next, we draw line CE perpendicular to DA so that Primary Gasing Triangle ACE is similar to triangle ADF.
Since ∠𝐴𝐶𝐸 = 𝛼, then AE = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼. Thus, DE = 1 – 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼. See Figure A2.5b.

Triangles ADF and DGE are similar. Using the scaling factor $&' % on triangle ADF, we obtain
triangle DGE.
Since DE = 1 – 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼, then

Nowsince𝐶𝐸 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼andEC=EG+GC,wehavetheequation
or
cos𝛼 =sin𝛼 ×(1−sin𝛼) + 1 ×(1−sin𝛼) cos 𝛼 cos 𝛼
cos. 𝛼 = sinα(1−sin𝛼) +(1−sin𝛼) cos. 𝛼 = 1 − sin. 𝛼
cos.𝛼 + sin.𝛼 = 1
Finally we have proven As we expected.

Case 6:
Figure A2.6a
In Figure A2.6a, we have the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC with three squares HICA, CGFB, and ABDE.
Here, the hypotenuse of the Primary Gasing Triangle ABC is AB = 1, the length of AC = cos 𝛼 and the length of CB = sin 𝛼.
From the figure, we get:
The area of square HICA = cos. 𝛼
The area of square CGFB =sin. 𝛼
The area of square ABDE = 1.
Now, we draw a line CK perpendicular to line AB.
 
 Figure A2.6b
Triangle CBK is similar to Primary Gasing Triangle ABC.
Since side BC = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼, the length of side BK = sin. 𝛼 (using the scaling factor 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝛼).
Similarly, since triangles ABC and ACK are similar, the length of side AK = = 𝑐𝑜𝑠.𝛼 (using the scaling factor 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝛼).
Since the length of side AE = BD = 1, then,
The area of AKJE = 𝐴𝐾 × 𝐴𝐸 = cos. 𝛼 . 1 = cos. 𝛼,
The area of KBDJ = 𝐾𝐵 × 𝐵𝐷 = sin. 𝛼. 1 = sin. 𝛼.
Since the area of ABDE = the area of AKJE + the area of KBDJ, Thus,
1 = cos. 𝛼 + sin. 𝛼

This equation simultaneously proves the Pythagorean theorem and shows that : the area of ABDE = the area of HICA + the area of CDFB.
The latter is often used for geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem.
Case 7
Gambar A2.7a
In Figure A2.7a, we have a trapezium ACHG divided into three right triangles: Primary Gasing Triangle ABC, Primary Gasing Triangle BGH, and Triangle AGB. The Primary Triangles ABC and BGH are congruent, with side AB = 1 and angle CAB = α.
Since Triangle ABC is a Primary Gasing Triangle, the lengths of the sides are BC = sin α and AC = cos α. Because triangles ABC and BGH are congruent, angle GBH = α (since line AB is perpendicular to BG). Therefore, BH = cos α and GH = sin α, as shown in Figure A2.7b.
 
 Gambar A2.7b
The area of trapezoid ACHG = 2 x the area of triangle ABC + the area of triangle AGB.
  or
as we expected.
(sin𝛼+cos𝛼)(sin𝛼+cos𝛼)=2 × (sin𝛼cos𝛼)+1 222
sin. 𝛼 + 2 sin 𝛼 cos 𝛼 + cos. 𝛼 = 2 sin 𝛼 cos 𝛼 + 1 sin.𝛼+cos.𝛼 = 1

Case 8
Here, we will work on the proof of the Pythagorean Theorem as performed by Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson using Primary Gasing Triangles.
Figure A2.8a
Here, we take the Gasing Triangle BAG with BA = 1 unit, GA =sin 𝛼, and BG = cos 𝛼.
Triangles BCG and BAG are congruent, so AC = 2 sin 𝛼.
Triangles BAG and DAC are similar. We use the scale factor $&' % on triangle BAG to obtain
"#$ %
triangle DAC. With this scale factor, we get the lengths AD = . $&' % and CD = = . $&' % sin 𝛼. "#$ % "#$ %
Next,since∠𝐷𝐶𝐹 = 𝛼,andwealreadyknowthelengthofCD,byusingthesimilarity
betweentrianglesDACandFCD,wegetthelengthsFC=.$&'!%sin𝛼andDF=.$&'! %sin𝛼. "#$! % "#$! %
We can continue this process until point E. The result is as shown in the following figure.

 Figure A2.8c
From the Gasing Triangle CBO (right-angled at O) with angle CBO = 2𝛼, we get that the length of OC = sin 2𝛼.
From triangle CAO (right-angled at O) with length CA = 2 sin 𝛼, we get the length of OC = 2 sin 𝛼 sin(90 − 𝛼) = 2 sin 𝛼 cos 𝛼.
So here we get sin 2𝛼 = 2 sin 𝛼 cos 𝛼 (without using the sum identity of sine). FromtriangleEBAwithangleEBA= 𝛼,wegetthatEA=EBsin2𝛼 =EB2sin𝛼cos𝛼. Substituting the values of EA and EB, we get
  or we get,
as we expected.
2sin𝛼cos𝛼 = cos.𝛼+sin.𝛼 2sin𝛼cos𝛼 (cos.𝛼−sin.𝛼) (cos.𝛼−sin.𝛼)
1 = cos. 𝛼 + sin. 𝛼
