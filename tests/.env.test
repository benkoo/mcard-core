# These values are used as fallbacks when environment variables are not set.
DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE = 10  # Maximum number of database connections
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30.0  # Timeout duration in seconds

# Environment Variable Names
# These constants represent the names of environment variables used for configuration.
# They are used to fetch configuration values from the environment, providing flexibility and security.

# Hashing Configuration
# Constants related to hashing operations, allowing for customization and flexibility.
# These constants are used to define hashing algorithms and custom hashing functions.
